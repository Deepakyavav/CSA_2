
For designing a scheduler that includes parsing, dependency detection, and instruction reordering based on a k-fetch width approach, you can follow these steps:

Parsing to Identify Instructions:

Read the assembly code line by line.
Use regular expressions or a custom parser to identify instructions, operands, labels, and other components.
Build a representation of the instructions and their operands in a format that facilitates dependency analysis.
Dependency Detection:

Perform data and control dependency analysis.
For data dependency, track the read and write registers of each instruction.
For control dependency, identify branches and their targets.
Use this information to determine dependencies between instructions.
Instruction Reordering for Scheduling:

Implement a scheduling algorithm based on the k-fetch width approach.
Divide the instructions into groups of k instructions, where k is the fetch width.
Within each group, schedule the instructions based on their dependencies to maximize parallel execution.
Ensure that at the beginning of each group, a target instruction is present, and at the end, a branch (conditional) instruction is present to maintain the correct program flow.


# Configuration File for Processor Design

# Fetch Width
FetchWidth = 4

# Number of Pipeline Stages
NumStages = 5

# Names of Pipeline Stages
StageNames = IF ID EX MEM WB

# Additional Components
# Add any other components you need, such as caches, branch predictors, etc.
CacheSize = 8192
BranchPredictor = bimodal



In this configuration file:

FetchWidth: Specifies the fetch width of the processor (number of instructions fetched per cycle).
NumStages: Specifies the total number of pipeline stages in the processor.
StageNames: Specifies the names of each pipeline stage, separated by spaces.
Additional components like cache size and branch predictor type are included as needed.
You can then write a Python script to read this configuration file and extract the parameters as required. Here's a simple example of how you could implement this
